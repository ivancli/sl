"Orange 2 Stroke Boost EQ Pedal","Orange","TWOSTROKE","225.00","199.00","Single Guitar Effects","The Two Stroke Boost EQ is Orange's take on the essential ‘clean boost’ pedal, but with even more versatility. Combining an active dual-parametric EQ and up to 12dB of output boost, the Two Stroke is the perfect tool for fine-tuning your sound or pushing your amp’s front end with unsurpassed control. Subtle  tweaks to the settings can add an extra dimension to solos, whilst more aggressive use of the pedal’s EQ can sculpt entirely new sounds. Use the Two Stroke to add an extra channel to your amplifier or re-voice your guitar’s pickups completely. Crank the high mids to jump through the mix, cut the low end to remove the woolliness that normally occurs with traditional boost pedals, or leave the EQ flat to hear more of what you already like. It’s also suitable for bass and acoustic guitars as a practical tool to remove unwanted ‘honk’ or feedback, making this pedal a valuable addition to any musician’s setup.","http://www.allansbillyhyde.com.au/prod/TWOSTROKE/Orange-2-Stroke-Boost-EQ-Pedal.aspx"

Achieving this easily, however, has always been a problem for guitar players with poor quality passive ABY boxes/line selectors loading the guitar signal down, degrading the tone and rendering the whole exercise almost pointless.

"Mesa Boogie Throttle Box EQ Distortion Guitar Effects Pedal","Mesa Boogie","FP.TEQ","499.00","429.00","Single Guitar Effects","New to Allans Billy Hyde, this Mesa Boogie THROTTLE BOX EQ™ effects pedal combines the enhanced shaping power of Mesa Boogie’s popular Five Band Graphic Equalizer with footswitchable HI/LO performance Modes and easy Top Panel access to the previously internal BOOST feature.
With the added shaping power the on-board Five Band EQ creates the THROTTLE BOX EQ can take your guitar sound anywhere .The middle range of the GAIN control delivers tight, stinging overdrive that–depending on whether you choose LO or HI GAIN Modes–can cover everything from Blues to Modern Metal with plenty of attitude and an urgent percussive nature. You can crank things up into the upper one-third of the GAIN control in HI unleashes a hot-rod that’s blistering with searing top-end harmonics. 
For the Hard Rock and Metal enthusiasts’ the Graphic EQ sis et to the popular mid-scooped “V-Curve” creating some of the heaviest sounds around. Yet with limitless curve possibilities, the Graphic expands the potential for sonic diversity across all styles as well as being able to unleash Mayhem.
Like the original, this expanded THROTTLE BOX includes two Modes but here they are controlled by a HI/LO footswitch that enables you to have two gain regions to choose from during live performance. There are also dedicated HI LEVEL and LO LEVEL Output controls, allowing you to set the desired volume level for each Gain Mode individually. The EQ can be assigned to either or both of these Gain Mode choices so that it becomes active with the desired Gain Mode selection. In addition, the fitted MID CUT control allows global scooping of the mids to whatever you might do with the Graphic sliders. And finally, the internally selectable BOOST switch hidden under the Bottom Plate on the original THROTTLE BOX appears on this EQ version as an easily accessible Top Panel BOOST switch for extra girth and a bit of gain enhancement. We at Allans Billy Hyde are confident this pedal will exceed your expectations and provide an inspiring tool for expression.

This guitar is excellent - for beginners needing a first guitar – all the way to professionals that need a new axe and a practice amp. It features an Appetite Amber finish over the AAA flame Maple Veneer top, inspired by Slash's own custom Les Paul. The body and neck are crafted from mahogany and is finished in beautiful dark Cherry just like Slash's original. The bolt-on neck is topped with a Rosewood fingerboard with dot acrylic inlays and the headstock features Slash's ""Snakepit"" logo in gold silk print along with the iconic Epiphone signature logo in silver. At the heart of every Les Paul is a pair of humbucker pickups kicking out the tone that has set the standard for rock and roll for over 50 years. This axe is fitted with Ceramic Plus Zebra Coil humbucker pickups, which provide the same crunch, power and performance that Slash hears when he cranks up his Les Paul. The bridge pickup also comes with a built-in Shadow E-Tuner.","http://www.allansbillyhyde.com.au/prod/PPGS-ENA2AANH3/Epiphone¶©-Les-Paul-Slash-AFD-Special-II-Electric-Guitar-Performance-Pack.aspx"

"Orange 2 Stroke Boost EQ Pedal","Orange","TWOSTROKE","225.00","199.00","Single Guitar Effects","The Two Stroke Boost EQ is Orange's take on the essential ‘clean boost’ pedal, but with even more versatility. Combining an active dual-parametric EQ and up to 12dB of output boost, the Two Stroke is the perfect tool for fine-tuning your sound or pushing your amp’s front end with unsurpassed control. Subtle  tweaks to the settings can add an extra dimension to solos, whilst more aggressive use of the pedal’s EQ can sculpt entirely new sounds. Use the Two Stroke to add an extra channel to your amplifier or re-voice your guitar’s pickups completely. Crank the high mids to jump through the mix, cut the low end to remove the woolliness that normally occurs with traditional boost pedals, or leave the EQ flat to hear more of what you already like. It’s also suitable for bass and acoustic guitars as a practical tool to remove unwanted ‘honk’ or feedback, making this pedal a valuable addition to any musician’s setup.","http://www.allansbillyhyde.com.au/prod/TWOSTROKE/Orange-2-Stroke-Boost-EQ-Pedal.aspx"

With the added shaping power the on-board Five Band EQ creates the THROTTLE BOX EQ can take your guitar sound anywhere .The middle range of the GAIN control delivers tight, stinging overdrive that–depending on whether you choose LO or HI GAIN Modes–can cover everything from Blues to Modern Metal with plenty of attitude and an urgent percussive nature. You can crank things up into the upper one-third of the GAIN control in HI unleashes a hot-rod that’s blistering with searing top-end harmonics. 
For the Hard Rock and Metal enthusiasts’ the Graphic EQ sis et to the popular mid-scooped “V-Curve” creating some of the heaviest sounds around. Yet with limitless curve possibilities, the Graphic expands the potential for sonic diversity across all styles as well as being able to unleash Mayhem.
Like the original, this expanded THROTTLE BOX includes two Modes but here they are controlled by a HI/LO footswitch that enables you to have two gain regions to choose from during live performance. There are also dedicated HI LEVEL and LO LEVEL Output controls, allowing you to set the desired volume level for each Gain Mode individually. The EQ can be assigned to either or both of these Gain Mode choices so that it becomes active with the desired Gain Mode selection. In addition, the fitted MID CUT control allows global scooping of the mids to whatever you might do with the Graphic sliders. And finally, the internally selectable BOOST switch hidden under the Bottom Plate on the original THROTTLE BOX appears on this EQ version as an easily accessible Top Panel BOOST switch for extra girth and a bit of gain enhancement. We at Allans Billy Hyde are confident this pedal will exceed your expectations and provide an inspiring tool for expression.

"Epiphone® Les Paul® Special II Electric Guitar (Heritage Sunburst)","Epiphone","ENJRHSCH1","429.00","299.00","Solid Body","The Epiphone® Les Paul® Special II Electric Guitar in the Heritage Sunburst finish is recognized as one of the best values around in no-nonsense, hard-rocking electric guitars. The Les Paul Special II with its combination of Les Paul-like features, great tones, and outstanding affordability has been satisfying the needs of demanding players for going on 20 years, becoming Epiphone’s best-selling guitar in the process. .
Like the Special II, this is a full-on, in-your-face, rockin’ machine with all the great specs you've come to expect from Epiphone — and now it offers even more to help you get the job done night after night, gig after gig. You’ll be amazed how the U.S.A.-designed 650R (neck) and 700T (bridge) pickups with their high-output magnets add more highs with increased definition and no muddiness. Slightly over-wound, the hotter 700T bridge pickup is smooth but can give you a little extra scream or growl when you need it, while never losing its rich combination of enhanced lows and crystal-clear highs.

This new model stays true to the original in every way, including the same round-shoulder dreadnought body design, with a top made from Adirondack red spruce, custom vintage top bracing and back and sides constructed from pattern-grade mahogany from Honduras.

By scalloping each brace by hand, the natural sound of the acoustic is focused more toward the center of the body, enhancing the instrument’s sound projection. This legendary bracing design delivers a balanced expression, with punchy, deep lows, warm mids, and clear, crisp highs. 
This Vintage Sunburst J-45 comes equipped with the popular Element Active Acoustic Pickup System from L.R. Baggs, which features a low-profile undersaddle element—or transducer—that’s proven more stable and durable than many standard ribbon-type pickups for a robust, lively, and natural acoustic sound with excellent dynamics and delicate high end.

First, it adjusts the phase relationships between the low, mid and high frequencies through adding progressively longer delay times to lower frequencies, creating a kind of mirror curve to neutralize the effect of loudspeaker phase distortion. Second, the Sonic Maximizer augments higher and lower frequencies as loudspeakers tend to be less efficient in their extreme treble and bass ranges. The end result is a dynamic, program-driven restoration which reveals more of the natural texture and detail in the sound without causing fatigue that is often associated with exciter effects, psychoacoustic processors or excessive use of equalizers.","http://www.allansbillyhyde.com.au/prod/BBE-482I/BBE-482i-Sonic-Maximizer-Processor.aspx"

First, it adjusts the phase relationships between the low, mid and high frequencies through adding progressively longer delay times to lower frequencies, creating a kind of mirror curve to neutralize the effect of loudspeaker phase distortion. Second, the Sonic Maximizer augments higher and lower frequencies as loudspeakers tend to be less efficient in their extreme treble and bass ranges. The end result is a dynamic, program-driven restoration which reveals more of the natural texture and detail in the sound without causing fatigue that is often associated with exciter effects, psychoacoustic processors or excessive use of equalizers.","http://www.allansbillyhyde.com.au/prod/BBE-482I/BBE-482i-Sonic-Maximizer-Processor.aspx"
